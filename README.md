# G-Earth Nervous Game
Extension built to automatically click the middle seat! How to use install it and get it working:

1. Download G-Earth. There is 64Bit and 32Bit, please use the correct one according to your computers operating system
2. Keep everything in this file (Geode.dll, Geode.Extension.Windows.dll, and websocket-sharp.dll, etc...)
3. Open the G-Earth folder and double click G-Earth and connect.
4. Once you have connected please double click the Dodgeball Bot that is in the Dodgeball Bot - Release folder
5. G-Earth will say "Extension "Dodgeball Bot" tries to connect but isn't known to G-Earth, accept this connection?"
6. Click YES
7. Once you do that please click Connect OR Activate on the extension
8. Click record for destiny, click the middle seat
9. Click record for either icecream, carrot or drink (black currant/milk/water)
11. There is an option for delay as well (0 = Fastest, 250 = Is good and looks less like a bot :P)
12. Click start so when the item has been gotten it will click but then it will disable by itself. Therefore, every round you need to start it. You can click 1 to start it as well (Hotkey)

# Important Note:

If you open the extension in the room for some reason it might just keep closing. The best way is to open the extenion in hotel view and then enter the room where you will want to use this extension in. I don't know why G-Earth sometimes bugs the code but please just open the extension in hotel view and then enter the room.

If you need help using this extension please message me on discord Ahmed#8333
